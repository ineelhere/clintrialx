The goal of `{clintrialx}` is to fetch clinical trials data from freely available registries. Currently, it supports the ClinicalTrials.gov registry using its [V2 API](https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/api).

## Installation

You can install this package from [GitHub](https://github.com/ineelhere/clintrialx) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ineelhere/clintrialx")
```
### Check installation
```r
library(clintrialx)
```

## Query Data based on NCT IDs

Fetch one or multiple trial records based on NCT IDs. You can opt to fetch some specific fields or all fields available at source (default).

```{r example1}
library(clintrialx)
ctg_get_nct(c("NCT02967965", "NCT04000165", "NCT01007279", "NCT02376244", "NCT01179776"),
                          fields = c("NCT Number", "Study Title", "Study Status", "Sponsor"))


```

## Query Data based on fileds

Supports filtering by condition, location, title keywords, intervention, and overall status.


```{r example2}
ctg_get_fields(
     condition = "Cancer",
     location = "Kolkata",
     title = NULL,
     intervention = "Drug",
     status = c("ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING", "RECRUITING"),
     page_size = 10
)

```


## Data Sources

You can fetch version information directly from the package:

```{r example3}
version_info(source = "clinicaltrials.gov")


```
