The goal of `{clintrialx}` is to fetch clinical trials data from freely available registries. Currently, it supports the ClinicalTrials.gov registry using its [V2 API](https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/api).

## Installation

You can install this package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ineelhere/clintrialx")
```

## Example

This is a basic example that shows how to download data based on NCT ID(s):

```{r example1}
library(clintrialx)
fetch_specific_trial_data("NCT04000165")
```

Fetch only a few/specific fields:

```{r example2}
library(clintrialx)
fetch_specific_trial_data("NCT04000165", fields = c("NCT Number", "Study Title", "Study Status", "Sponsor"))
```

You can also download data for multiple NCT IDs:

```{r example3}
library(clintrialx)
fetch_specific_trial_data(c("NCT02967965", "NCT04000165", "NCT01007279", "NCT02376244", "NCT01179776"))
```

Similarly, you can query only desired fields:

```{r example4}
library(clintrialx)
fetch_specific_trial_data(c("NCT02967965", "NCT04000165", "NCT01007279", "NCT02376244", "NCT01179776"),
                          fields = c("NCT Number", "Study Title", "Study Status", "Sponsor"))
```

## Data Sources

You can fetch version information directly from the package:

```{r example}
library(clintrialx)
version_info(source = "clinicaltrials.gov")
```
