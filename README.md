The goal of `{clintrialx}` is to fetch clinical trials data from freely
available registries. Currently, it supports the ClinicalTrials.gov
registry using its [V2 API](https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/api).

## Installation

You can install this package from
[GitHub](https://github.com/ineelhere/clintrialx) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ineelhere/clintrialx")
```

### Check installation

``` r
library(clintrialx)
```

## Query Data based on NCT IDs

Fetch one or multiple trial records based on NCT IDs. You can opt to
fetch some specific fields or all fields available at source (default).

``` r
library(clintrialx)

#> Loading required package: lubridate
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'lubridate'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':

#> Loading required package: readr

                          fields = c("NCT Number", "Study Title", "Study Status", "Sponsor"))

## Query Data based on fileds

Supports filtering by condition, location, title keywords, intervention,
and overall status.

``` r
query_clinical_trials(
     condition = "Cancer",
     location = "Kolkata",
     title = NULL,
     intervention = "Drug",
     status = c("ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING", "RECRUITING"),
     page_size = 10
)
#> The Query matches 82 trial records in the ClinicalTrials.gov records.
#> Your query returned 10 trial records.
