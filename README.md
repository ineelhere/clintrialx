The goal of `{clintrialx}` is to fetch clinical trials data from freely
available registries. Currently, it supports querying the

- [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) registry using its
  [V2 API](https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/api) and

- [CTTI AACT](https://aact.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/) (Public Access to
  Aggregate Content of ClinicalTrials.gov).

## Installation

You can install this package from
[GitHub](https://github.com/ineelhere/clintrialx) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ineelhere/clintrialx")
```

### Check installation

``` r
library(clintrialx)
```

## Setup AACT account

#### `Only if you wish to use AACT as a source for the data`

- Visit <https://aact.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/users/sign_up>

- Sign up and create an account. Itâ€™s free.

- The `username` and `password` will be needed to fetch data using this
  package.

- Save it in a `.Renviron` file, for example-

  ``` r
  user =  "random_name"
  password = "random_password"
  ```

- Now that the file is created, load the variable with the command
  `readRenviron("path/to/.Renviron)`

- Youâ€™re all set!

## Query the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) Registry

#### Based on NCT IDs

Fetch one or multiple trial records based on NCT IDs. You can opt to
fetch some specific fields or all fields available at source (default).

#### Based on fileds

Supports filtering by condition, location, title keywords, intervention,
and overall status.

``` r
ctg_get_fields(
     condition = "Cancer",
     location = "Kolkata",
     title = NULL,
     intervention = "Drug",
     status = c("ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING", "RECRUITING"),
     page_size = 10
)

## Query the [CTTI AACT](https://aact.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/)

#### Run Custom Queries

``` r
# Set environment variables for database credentials in .Renviron and load it
# readRenviron(".Renviron")

# Connect to the database
con <- aact_connection(Sys.getenv('user'), Sys.getenv('password'))

# Run a custom query
query <- "SELECT nct_id, source, enrollment, overall_status FROM studies LIMIT 5;"
results <- aact_custom_query(con, query)

# Print the results
print(results)
#>        nct_id                                 source enrollment
#> 1 NCT00977600                                  Amgen         24
